# AVL Tree Implementation

This repository contains a C++ implementation of an AVL (Adelson-Velsky and Landis) tree, a self-balancing binary search tree.

## Features

- **Balanced Structure:** Automatically maintains a balanced structure to ensure efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.

- **Recursive Operations:** Utilizes recursive algorithms for tree traversal, insertion, and deletion.

- **Rotation:** Implements left and right rotations to rebalance the tree when needed.
